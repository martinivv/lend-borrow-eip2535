## Withdrawing

To withdraw tokens, ensure:

1. The debt associated with `tokenAddress` has been repaid.
2. The `_tokenAmount` is greater than 0.

In return, the mTokens given on the deposit will be burnt from circulation.

## After Withdrawing

You'll have your tokens + interest if weren't used as collateral.
