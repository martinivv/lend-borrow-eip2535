## Being a Keeper: Liquidation

To liquidate an account, make sure the account's collateral is undercollateralized — **borrowed in USD > threshold of the token × amount in USD**.

In return you'll receive reward — 50 % of the exceeded USD amount in account's collateral tokens.

## Keep in mind

Self-liquidation is not enabled.
